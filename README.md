### Hi there, I'm Ashkan 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Architect based in The Hague, Netherlands, with a passion for building scalable, resilient, and intelligent software systems. With over 8 years of experience, I've moved from crafting large-scale .NET enterprise applications to architecting modern, cloud-native solutions.

My journey is driven by a simple principle: using the right tools to solve complex problems elegantly and efficiently.

#### 🚀 What I'm Focused On Now

My recent work explores the intersection of **Cloud Infrastructure**, **DevOps Automation**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. I'm particularly interested in:

* **Cloud-Native Architecture:** Designing systems that are born in the cloud, leveraging technologies like **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and serverless functions for ultimate scalability and resilience.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automating everything with tools like **Terraform** and **Pulumi** to create predictable and repeatable environments.
* **AI-Enhanced Tooling:** Integrating AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into developer and data tools to create smarter, more intuitive user experiences (like my `grafana-ai` plugin).
* **High-Performance Backend Systems:** Writing clean, concurrent, and efficient backend services, primarily in **Go** and **C#**.

#### 🌱 Learning & Collaboration

I'm always learning and believe in the power of open source. Having recently archived my `Dedicated-IP` service to make it public, I'm now actively seeking my next big challenge.

* 💞️ &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects that push the boundaries of cloud and AI.
* 🤝 &nbsp; I'm open to new opportunities, whether joining a visionary team or partnering with founders on a new venture.
